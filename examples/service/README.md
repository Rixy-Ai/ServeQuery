## ðŸš€ How to Run the ServeQuery UI Service

You have two options for running the ServeQuery UI service:

### ðŸ”¸ Option 1: Using Docker (recommended)

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.
2. Run the service using the provided script:

```bash
bash run_service.sh
```

This will start the ServeQuery UI at:  
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

---

### ðŸ”¸ Option 2: Run Locally without Docker

Alternatively, you can start the ServeQuery UI service directly in your terminal (if ServeQuery is installed in your Python environment):

```bash
servequery ui
```

The service will be available at:  
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

---

## ðŸ“Š Upload the Demo Project

Once the UI service is running, you can upload a demo project by running:

```bash
python remote_demo_project.py
```

This script will:

- Connect to the ServeQuery service at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Create a sample project for bike rental monitoring
- Upload a few simulated data runs
- Add a dashboard panel to visualize metrics

You can then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to explore the project and its reports.
